# Crop-Recommendation-with-AI

The Purpose of this project is to help agricultural farmers to get informed decisions about the farming strategy. 
To do this, a dataset obtained from a Kaggle expert named Atharva Ingle was used. 
The dataset was used to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.
It is important to note that Atharva Ingle built the dataset by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.

## Data field

P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil
Temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
Humidity - relative humidity in %
Ph - ph value of the soil. Soils can be classified according to their pH value: 6.5 to 7.5—neutral, over 7.5— alkaline and less than 6.5—acidic
Rainfall - rainfall in mm
Lable - 22 Crops each with 100 observations
